  <h1>Phase 3b: Term Project Sketches (Final)</h1>
  <h2>Pattamaporn Jamjumrus</h2>

  <!-- ===== SKETCH 1 ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Sketch 1: Scatterplot</h3>
    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The longer the hours spent outside, the higher my daily reflection.</p>
    <p>
    
      <strong>X-axis:</strong> Hours Spent Outside (0–10)<br>
      <strong>Y-axis:</strong> Daily Reflection (0–5)<br>
      <strong>Representation:</strong> Scatterplot — bubble color shows moodOutside (1–5).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Design Details:</strong>For this graph, a color palette was selected to communicate emotional states in a clear
      and intuitive manner. Warm tones such as red represent more intense or heightened emotions, whereas cool tones such as green 
      indicate calmer feelings. This warm-to-cool gradient enables viewers to quickly interpret emotional variations across different days. 
      Additionally, the use of varying circle sizes enhances readability, reduces visual complexity, and supports more effective data interpretation.</p>
      
    <p>This visualization examines whether spending more time outdoors increases self-reflection will related with purchased condition.</p>

  <!-- ===== SKETCH 2 ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Sketch 2: Parallel Coordination Chart</h3>
    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> When both hours outside and money spent increase, 
    <br>daily reflection tends to decrease.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data used:</strong> HoursOutside, MoneySpent, DailyReflection<br>
      <strong>Units:</strong> hours (0–10), money ($0–200), reflection (0–5)<br>
      <strong>Representation:</strong> 2D plot with color scale for reflection.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Design Details:</strong>
    A Line Graph was chosen to present multiple variables simultaneously. 
    Although this approach may initially appear complex, the application of distinct 
    colors explicitly identified in the legend allows users to differentiate variables 
    with ease and observe changes over time. The color separation improves overall clarity 
    and provides structured foundation for analyzing variations among datasets.
    <p>
      This plot explores how lifestyle spending may influence self-reflection despite more time spent outside.

  <!-- ===== SKETCH 3 ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Sketch 3: Calendar table data collection</h3>
    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As the number of locations visited decreases, the number of purchased meals also decreases, while mood outside tends to increase.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data used:</strong> LocationsVisited, MealsPurchased, MoodOutside<br>
      <strong>Representation:</strong> Creative visual no axis, uses colors or pattern to show relational change.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Design Details:</strong>This visualization is designed based on a daily recording format commonly used in personal planning tools, 
      such as calendar based to do lists. Employing a structure that aligns with familiar daily routines facilitates more consistent data 
      collection and enhances user engagement. This format also allows day to day changes to be tracked more clearly, resulting in a more intuitive and accessible analysis process.</p>
    <p>
      This visualization represents collecting data in different style,using calendar which can lead data to easier organize as well.
